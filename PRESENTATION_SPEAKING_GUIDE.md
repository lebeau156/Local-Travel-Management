## USDA Local Travel Voucher System

**Total Time: 30 minutes**
- Presentation: 20 minutes
- Demo: 5 minutes
- Q&A: 5 minutes

---

## OPENING (2 minutes)

### What to Say:

*"Good morning/afternoon. Thank you for your time today.*

*My name is [Your Name], and I'm here to present a solution to a problem that's been costing USDA thousands of dollars and countless hours every single month.*

*Before I dive into the technical details, let me tell you a story about why this system exists."*

### The Story:

*"I've had the privilege of working closely with [Supervisor Name], a Front Line Supervisor who manages 12 field inspectors. I watched her struggle with a process that frankly, no one in 2026 should have to deal with.*

*Every month, she receives travel vouchers from her inspectors—the AD-616 forms you're all familiar with. Some are handwritten and scanned. Some are filled out incorrectly. Some never arrive.*

*Once they do arrive, she prints every single one. Then she manually reviews each trip, checking dates, verifying mileage using Google Maps, looking for errors.*

*If she finds errors—and 30% of the time she does—she has to email the inspector to resubmit.*

*Once everything is correct, she signs each form by hand, scans them one by one, merges them into a single PDF—sometimes 50+ pages—and emails it to the fleet manager.*

*This process takes her 10 hours every month. That's a full day and a quarter of her time spent on paperwork instead of supporting her team in the field.*

*The inspectors aren't happy either. They spend 2+ hours filling out forms, and then they have no idea if their voucher was received, approved, or lost in someone's inbox.*

*This isn't just inefficient. It's demoralizing."*

### The Transition:

*"So I asked myself: What if we could eliminate 90% of that work? What if we could give supervisors their time back and give inspectors peace of mind?*

*That's what I'm here to show you today."*

## SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM (3 minutes)

### Key Points to Hit:

1. **Paper-based process is broken**
   - "Our current system was designed for a pre-internet world"
   - "It wastes time, creates errors, and frustrates everyone"

2. **Quantify the pain**
   - "Let me put some numbers to this pain:"
   - "$50,000 per year per district in wasted labor"
   - "300+ pages printed per supervisor per month"
   - "30% error rate requiring resubmission"
   - "Zero visibility into voucher status"

3. **It affects everyone**
   - "This isn't just a supervisor problem or an inspector problem"
   - "Fleet managers waste hours navigating 50-page PDFs"
   - "Accounting manually re-enters data into spreadsheets"
   - "Inspectors wait weeks for reimbursement"

### What to Show:

**[SHOW SLIDE: Current Process Diagram]**

*"Let me walk you through the current process:"*

1. Inspector fills AD-616 by hand → 20 minutes
2. Inspector calculates mileage separately → 15 minutes
3. Inspector scans and emails → 10 minutes
4. Supervisor prints all forms → 20 minutes
5. Supervisor reviews manually → 2+ hours
6. Supervisor signs, scans, merges PDF → 30 minutes
7. Supervisor emails to fleet manager
8. Fleet manager opens 50-page PDF, reviews, approves

*"Total time: Over 4 hours of labor for a single month's vouchers from one inspector."*

*"Multiply that by 12 inspectors... by 4 supervisors... across the entire district."*

*"This is costing us tens of thousands of dollars per year, per district."*

**[ADVANCE TO NEXT SLIDE]**

## SECTION 2: THE SOLUTION (4 minutes)

### Opening:

*"Now let me show you a better way."*

### Key Message:

*"We built a fully digital travel voucher management system that reduces this 4-hour process to 5 minutes."*

### How to Present:

**[SHOW SLIDE: System Overview]**

*"Here's how it works:"*

### For Inspectors:

*"Inspectors log their trips throughout the month—right after each field visit—using their phone or computer."*

*"The form is simple: Date, From, To, Purpose. That's it."*

*"Google Maps automatically calculates the mileage. No more MapQuest. No more manual calculations."*

*"At the end of the month, the inspector clicks 'Generate Voucher.' All their trips are compiled into a digital AD-616 form with accurate totals."*

*"They review it, click 'Submit,' and they're done."*

*"Total time: 5 minutes."*

### For Supervisors:

*"Supervisors log in and see a dashboard with all pending vouchers."*

*"They click on an inspector's name and see all their trips for the month—displayed on a map."*

*"They can verify dates, review purposes, check mileage—all in one screen."*

*"If everything looks good, they click 'Approve.' If there's an issue, they click 'Return' and leave a comment."*

*"The system automatically forwards approved vouchers to the fleet manager."*

*"Total time per voucher: 2 minutes."*

*"For 12 inspectors: 30 minutes instead of 10 hours."*

### For Fleet Managers:

*"Fleet managers see all vouchers from across the district in one searchable, filterable dashboard."*

*"They can pull up any inspector's profile, see their supervisory chain, review their travel patterns."*

*"They can export everything to Excel for accounting in one click."*

*"Analytics show total mileage, costs, trends—data that was impossible to see with paper forms."*

### The Impact:

*"90% time savings for supervisors."*

*"95% time savings for inspectors."*

*"Zero paper."*

*"100% transparency—everyone knows where their voucher is at all times."*

**[PAUSE FOR EFFECT]**

*"And here's the best part: this costs less than what we're spending now."*

**[ADVANCE TO NEXT SLIDE]**

## SECTION 3: COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS (3 minutes)

### Opening:

*"Let's talk about money."*

### Current Costs:

**[SHOW SLIDE: Cost Comparison]**

*"Right now, we're spending approximately $50,000 per year per district on this paper-based process."*

*"That's labor costs—inspectors, supervisors, fleet managers—spent on paperwork."*

*"Add in printing, scanning, mailing, storage, error rework... it adds up fast."*

### New System Costs:

*"This digital system will cost $55,840 in Year 1."*

*"That includes one-time development, cloud hosting, Google Maps API, training, and support."*

*"But here's the key: Year 2 and beyond, it costs only $28,340."*

### ROI:

*"Break-even point: 14 months."*

*"After that, we save over $20,000 per year, per district."*

*"Over 5 years, that's $109,200 in savings per district."*

*"And that's just direct costs. The intangible benefits—happier employees, faster reimbursements, better data—are worth far more."*

### Scaling:

*"Even better: this system scales."*

*"The more districts we add, the better the ROI."*

*"If we roll this out to 10 districts, we're talking about a million dollars in savings over 5 years."*

**[PAUSE]**

*"But again, this isn't just about money. It's about respecting our employees' time and giving them the tools they deserve."*

## SECTION 5: SECURITY & COMPLIANCE (2 minutes)

### Opening:

*"I know what you're thinking: 'This sounds great, but what about security?'"*

### Key Points:

**[SHOW SLIDE: Security Features]**

*"We take security very seriously. This system meets all USDA requirements:"*

1. **FISMA Moderate Standards**
   - "Compliant with federal security standards"

2. **Encryption**
   - "All data encrypted in transit and at rest"

3. **Access Controls**
   - "Inspectors only see their own data"
   - "Supervisors only see their assigned team"
   - "Role-based permissions for everyone"

4. **Audit Trail**
   - "Every action logged with timestamp"
   - "Who did what, when—fully traceable"

5. **PIV Card Ready**
   - "System designed to integrate with PIV card authentication"
   - "Currently uses secure email/password, but PIV is on the roadmap"

6. **Compliance**
   - "Federal Records Act compliant"
   - "Section 508 accessible"
   - "Privacy Act safeguards"

### Reassurance:

*"In fact, this system is more secure than paper forms sitting in filing cabinets or PDFs sent via email."*

*"We have daily backups, disaster recovery, and 99.9% uptime guarantee."*

**[ADVANCE TO NEXT SLIDE]**

## SECTION 6: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (3 minutes)

### Opening:

*"So how do we actually make this happen?"*

### The Approach:

*"We're not proposing a big-bang, nationwide rollout."*

*"We're proposing a phased, measured approach with clear checkpoints."*

**[SHOW SLIDE: Implementation Timeline]**

### Phase 1: Pilot (Months 1-2)

*"Phase 1 is a small pilot: one supervisor, 12 inspectors."*

*"We provide:"*
- 2-hour training session
- Video tutorials and user manuals
- Daily support during first 2 weeks
- Ongoing email/phone support

*"After 2 months, we evaluate:"*
- Did users adopt it? (Target: 90%)
- Did it save time? (Target: 70% reduction)
- Are users happy? (Target: 4/5 rating)
- Were there any major issues?

*"If the pilot succeeds, we move to Phase 2."*

*"If it doesn't, we reevaluate or discontinue. Minimal risk."*

---

### Phase 2: Circuit Rollout (Months 3-4)

*"Phase 2 expands to the full state: 3-4 circuits."*

*"We collect more feedback, optimize the system, iron out any issues."*

*"Success metric: 85% of vouchers submitted digitally."*

---

### Phase 3: Regional Expansion (Months 5-8)

*"Phase 3 goes multi-state."*

*"We scale the infrastructure, add advanced analytics, establish help desk support."*

*"Success metric: 80% paperless submissions, 99% system uptime."*

---

### Phase 4: Nationwide (Months 9-12)

*"Phase 4 is the full rollout across all FSIS districts."*

*"Integration with USDA financial systems."*

*"Nationwide training and ongoing support."*

*"Success metric: 95% digital submissions, high user satisfaction, positive ROI."*

---

### Risk Mitigation:

*"Every phase has clear success metrics."*

*"We don't proceed to the next phase unless the previous one succeeded."*

*"This is a controlled, measured rollout—not a risky experiment."*

## SECTION 7: ADDRESSING CONCERNS (3 minutes)

### Setup:

*"I want to address the concerns I anticipate some of you might have."*

**[SHOW SLIDE: Common Concerns]**

---

### Concern #1: "Our inspectors aren't tech-savvy"

**Response:**

*"I hear this a lot. But here's the reality:"*

*"If your inspectors can send an email—and they all can—they can use this system."*

*"It's designed for simplicity. Three clicks. That's it."*

*"And we provide extensive training:"*
- 2-hour hands-on workshop
- Video tutorials they can watch anytime
- User manuals with screenshots
- Help desk support

*"Most users are productive within one week."*

---

### Concern #2: "What if the system goes down?"

**Response:**

*"Great question. Here's our answer:"*

*"99.9% uptime guarantee. That's industry standard for cloud systems."*

*"Daily backups. If something catastrophic happens, we can restore everything."*

*"Disaster recovery plan. We have procedures in place."*

*"And here's the thing: the current system 'goes down' all the time."*
- Scanners break
- Emails get lost
- PDFs get corrupted

*"This system is actually more reliable than what we have now."*

---

### Concern #3: "Training will take too long"

**Response:**

*"2 hours. That's the training session."*

*"Most people are comfortable after that."*

*"And for those who need more help, we have video tutorials, user manuals, and a help desk."*

*"Compare that to the time wasted on the current system: 10+ hours per month per supervisor."*

*"Even if training takes a full day, the ROI is there within the first month."*

---

### Concern #4: "This seems expensive"

**Response:**

*"$55,840 for Year 1. That includes development, hosting, training, everything."*

*"Year 2 and beyond: $28,340 per year."*

*"The current system costs $50,000+ per year per district."*

*"Break-even: 14 months."*

*"5-year savings: $109,200 per district."*

*"Continuing the paper system is more expensive."*

---

### Concern #5: "What about security?"

**Response:**

*"We already covered this, but to reiterate:"*
- FISMA moderate compliant
- Encrypted data
- Role-based access
- Complete audit trail
- PIV card integration ready

*"This system is more secure than paper forms or email PDFs."*

## CLOSING: CALL TO ACTION (2 minutes)

### The Ask:

*"So here's what we're asking for today:"*

**[SHOW SLIDE: What We Need]**

1. **Approval to launch a 3-month pilot program**
   - One supervisor, 12 inspectors
   - Low risk, high reward

2. **Budget allocation: $55,840 for Year 1**
   - Covers development, hosting, training, support

3. **Designation of pilot circuit**
   - We recommend New Jersey Circuit 01 (but open to suggestions)

4. **Stakeholder support**
   - IT security team collaboration
   - Supervisor and inspector buy-in
   - Fleet manager engagement

---

### The Why:

*"Why should you approve this?"*

*"Because this isn't just about saving time and money—though we will save both."*

*"This is about respecting our employees."*

*"Our field inspectors work hard every single day to keep America's food supply safe."*

*"They drive thousands of miles a year. They visit plants in all weather conditions. They do critical work that protects public health."*

*"They deserve modern tools that make their jobs easier, not harder."*

*"They deserve a system that respects their time."*

*"And frankly, in 2026, they shouldn't have to fill out forms by hand, calculate mileage manually, and wait weeks for reimbursement."*

---

### The Vision:

*"Imagine a USDA where:"*
- Field staff spend time on their mission, not paperwork
- Supervisors have time to coach and support, not scan documents
- Fleet managers make data-driven decisions with real-time analytics
- Everyone has transparency and accountability

*"That's the future this system enables."*

*"And it's a future we can start building today—with a small pilot program and a modest investment."*

---

### Final Words:

*"The world is changing. Technology is evolving. Government should too."*

*"Let's lead by example. Let's show that USDA is a modern, innovative organization that values its employees and uses taxpayer dollars wisely."*

*"Let's give our inspectors the tools they deserve."*

**[PAUSE]**

*"Thank you for your time. I'm happy to answer any questions."*

---

## Q&A TIPS (5 minutes)

### General Approach:

- **Listen carefully** to the full question
- **Pause** before answering (shows thoughtfulness)
- **Repeat** the question if needed for clarity
- **Answer directly**, then provide supporting details
- **Be honest** if you don't know something—offer to follow up

---

### Likely Questions & Suggested Answers:

#### Q: "How long did it take to build this?"

**A:** *"We built the initial version in about 3 months. It's a fully functional system ready for pilot testing. If approved, we can launch the pilot within 2-4 weeks after IT security clearance."*

---

#### Q: "What if inspectors don't have smartphones?"

**A:** *"The system works on any device with a web browser: desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone. Inspectors can log trips from their office computers or at home. That said, most inspectors do have smartphones with data plans, which is what the current email-based system already requires."*

---

#### Q: "Can we customize the system for our specific needs?"

**A:** *"Absolutely. One of the advantages of building this in-house is that we have full control. We can add features, modify workflows, integrate with other USDA systems—whatever you need. The pilot phase is specifically designed to collect feedback and make improvements."*

---

#### Q: "What happens to historical paper records?"

**A:** *"Historical records remain in their current format (paper or PDF). This system handles new vouchers going forward. However, we can scan and import historical data if needed for analytics or record-keeping purposes."*

---

#### Q: "Who will support this system after launch?"

**A:** *"We've budgeted for ongoing support: a help desk, email support, and admin support. Additionally, the system is designed to be low-maintenance—cloud hosting handles most infrastructure management automatically."*

---

#### Q: "What if an inspector makes a mistake in a submitted voucher?"

**A:** *"Supervisors can return vouchers with comments. The inspector receives an email notification, can edit the voucher, and resubmit. The audit trail tracks all changes. This is actually easier than the current system, where correcting errors requires printing, scanning, and re-emailing."*

---

#### Q: "How do you calculate mileage?"

**A:** *"We use the Google Maps Directions API—the same technology people use every day for navigation. It calculates the driving distance between two addresses using current road data. Supervisors can review the calculated mileage and adjust it if needed (for example, if an inspector took a different route)."*

---

#### Q: "What about inspectors with limited internet access?"

**A:** *"The system requires minimal bandwidth—it works on basic mobile data connections. For areas with truly no internet, inspectors can save trips as drafts offline and submit when they have connectivity. But realistically, if they can send emails now, they can use this system."*

---

#### Q: "What's the environmental impact?"

**A:** *"Significant. We estimate 24,000 pages saved per year per district. Multiply that by dozens of districts, and we're talking about hundreds of thousands of pages. This aligns with federal sustainability goals and USDA's commitment to environmental responsibility."*

---

#### Q: "Can this be adapted for other types of travel (not just local)?"

**A:** *"Yes. The system is designed for local travel vouchers (AD-616), but the architecture supports other voucher types. We could add overnight travel, conference travel, etc. with additional development."*

---

#### Q: "What if the pilot doesn't work?"

**A:** *"Then we stop. The pilot is specifically designed as a low-risk test. If users don't adopt it, if it doesn't save time, or if there are critical issues we can't resolve, we discontinue and write it off as a learning experience. The investment is modest enough that the risk is acceptable."*

---

### If You Don't Know the Answer:

*"That's a great question. I don't have the answer off the top of my head, but I'll research it and follow up with you by [specific timeframe]. Can I get your contact information?"*
