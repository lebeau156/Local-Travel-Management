## Dashboard Count Issue

**You noticed:** Dashboard shows "0 Inspectors" even though you have 18 CSI members.

**Why?** The dashboard is counting by exact position match. Your imported members have position "CSI" but the dashboard might be looking for "Inspector" or a different position name.

**Where are the members?**
- Total Team Members: **26** ✓ (this is correct - you had 8 before + 18 new = 26)
- They're all visible in the Team Management table ✓
- They're just not categorized as "Inspectors" in the count

**Do you want me to fix the dashboard counts?** I can update the logic to count CSI members as Inspectors.
