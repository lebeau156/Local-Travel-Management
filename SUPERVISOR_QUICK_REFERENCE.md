## 🎯 Managing 100+ Inspectors

### Strategy 1: Filter by Region
Instead of scrolling through 100+ names:
```
1. State: [Your primary state]
2. Apply Filters
→ See only inspectors in that state
```

### Strategy 2: Focus on Pending
Only show what needs your attention:
```
1. Status: Pending Supervisor
2. Apply Filters
→ See only vouchers awaiting approval
→ Inspector column shows who submitted each one
```

### Strategy 3: Review by Time Period
Process vouchers chronologically:
```
1. Month: [Oldest first]
2. Year: [Start with previous year]
3. Status: Pending Supervisor
4. Apply Filters
→ Work through backlog systematically
```

### Strategy 4: Track Specific Inspectors
For inspectors you oversee closely:
```
1. Inspector: [Name]
2. Status: All Statuses
3. Apply Filters
→ Full history for performance review
```
