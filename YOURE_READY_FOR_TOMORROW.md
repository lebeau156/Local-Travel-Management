## 🎤 OPENING LINES (Practice These)

**Option 1 (Personal Story):**
> "Good morning. Before I dive into the technical details, let me tell you a story. I watched my supervisor spend 10+ hours every month printing, reviewing, signing, scanning, and merging PDFs for travel vouchers. Meanwhile, inspectors filled out complex AD-616 forms by hand, with 30% requiring resubmission due to errors. This isn't just inefficient—it's demoralizing. In 2026, we can do better."

**Option 2 (Direct Impact):**
> "Good morning. Today I'm going to show you how to save $109,200 per district over 5 years while making our field inspectors' lives easier. We're going to take a paper-based process that wastes 10+ hours per month and reduce it to 30 minutes. And I'm going to show you the working system, live, right now."

**Option 3 (Problem-First):**
> "Show of hands: How many of you have ever filled out an AD-616 travel voucher by hand? [Wait for hands] How many of you enjoyed that experience? [Laughter] Exactly. That's the problem we're solving today."

---

## 🌟 CLOSING LINES (Memorize This)

> "So let me recap what we're asking for today:
> 
> 1. **Approval to launch a 3-month pilot** with one supervisor and 12 inspectors
> 2. **Budget allocation of $55,840** for Year 1
> 3. **Stakeholder support** from IT, supervisors, and inspectors
> 
> Why should you approve this?
> 
> Because our field inspectors work hard every single day to keep America's food supply safe. They drive thousands of miles. They work in all weather. They do critical work that protects public health.
> 
> **They deserve modern tools that respect their time.**
> 
> This system gives them that.
> 
> Let's start with a small pilot—low risk, high reward.
> 
> Thank you for your time. I'm happy to answer questions."
